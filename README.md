# odin_recipes
This is the first project, recipes websites, in TOP

This project is a good place to practice what I have learned so far and test how much I have learned and understood.
Mainly three specific technical (hard skills)...
1. HTML
2. Using Git and Github
3. Using commandline 

Apart from these three technical skills, I can also practice soft skills like...
1. Keeping my code, files, folders organized.
2. Writing good, often commit messages
3. Good readme file, that explains the project.
